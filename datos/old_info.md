#Pitching:

-Basic Pitching
    -**(W)** Wins: credited to pitcher on winning team who last pitched before the team took a lead that it never relinquished (a starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings to qualify for a win)
    -**(L)** Losses: charged to pitcher on losing team who was pitching when the opposing team took a lead that it never relinquished
    -**(SV)**Saves: games where the pitcher enters a game led by the pitcher's team, finishes the game without surrendering the lead, is not the winning pitcher, and either (a) the lead was three runs or less when the pitcher entered the game; (b) the potential tying run was on base, at bat, or on deck; or (c) the pitcher pitched three or more innings
    -Innings pitched: outs recorded while pitching divided by three (partial innings are conventionally recorded as, e.g., "5.2" or "7.1", the last digit actually representing thirds, not tenths, of an inning)
    -Strikeouts: times pitching three strikes to a batter
    -Winning percentage: wins divided by decisions (wins plus losses)
    Earned run average (ERA): runs allowed, excluding those resulting from fielding errors, per nine innings pitched



#Bating 
-Basic Batting
	-**(AB)** At bats: plate appearances, excluding walks and hit by pitches—where the batter's ability is not fully tested—and sacrifices and sacrifice flies—where the batter intentionally makes an out in 	order to advance one or more baserunners
	-**(H)** Hits: times reached base because of a batted, fair ball without fielding error or fielder's choice
	-**(R)** Runs: times circling the bases and reaching home safely. 
	-**(RBI)** Runs batted in (RBIs): number of runners who scored due to a batter's action (including the batter, in the case of a home run), except when batter grounded into double play or reached on an error
	-**(HR)** Home runs: hits on which the batter successfully touched all four bases, without the contribution of a fielding error

- Batting average: hits divided by at bats—the traditional measure of batting ability

- The basic baserunning statistics include:
    -**(SB)** Stolen bases: times advancing to the next base entirely due to the runner's own efforts, generally while the pitcher is preparing to deliver or delivering the ball
    -**(CS)** Caught stealing: times tagged out while attempting to steal a base
- Others:
